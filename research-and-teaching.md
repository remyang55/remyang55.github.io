My current research is on programming languages and approximate computing, but I'm always interested in reading/learning/researching any exciting topics in computer science!

#### Approximate and Resilient Computing Group ####
(March 2020 - ) I am working on probabilistic programming in the context of low-precision computations with [Jacob Laurel](https://jsl1994.github.io/) and [Professor Sasa Misailovic](http://misailo.cs.illinois.edu/). Our paper on fixed-point probabilistic programming was recently accepted to DAC '21 and is cited below. We are in the process of open-sourcing our code, which will be linked here soon.
* **Statheros: Compiler for Efficient Low-Precision Probabilistic Programming**  
Jacob Laurel, <u>Rem Yang</u>, Atharva Sehgal, Shubham Ugare, Sasa Misailovic  
_Accepted to the 58th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference, 2021._  

#### Laboratory for Advanced Space Systems at Illinois ####
(September 2019 - March 2020) I built an automated system to measure the moment of inertia of [LASSI](https://lassiaero.web.illinois.edu/)'s CubeSat and tested the satellite's attitude determination software. I also worked on a browser-based graphical interface for the lab's mission operations center.

#### Teaching (Course Assistant) ###
(Fall 2020 & Spring 2021) [CS 225 Data Structures](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs225/sp2021/). Current office hours: Monday 00:00 - 02:00 CST  
I help students with MPs and labs in weekly lab sections and office hours.  

(Spring 2020) [CS 126 Software Design Studio](https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/cs126/sp2020/staff/).  
I facilitated weekly 2-hour code reviews with 5 students, which consisted of project presentations and discussions of program design, style, and testing; graded student projects.
