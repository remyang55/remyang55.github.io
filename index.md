Hope you're having a great day, thanks for stopping by!  
I am a student at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/) (UIUC) working on research at the intersection of programming languages and machine learning. Please send me an email if you'd like to talk about anything at all!

## Experience ##
<hr style="margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: 1em; height: 2px; background-color:black; border:none" />

### **Approximate and Resilient Computing Group** ###
(*Current*: Spring 2020 - ) Working with and mentored by [Jacob Laurel](https://jsl1994.github.io/), [Professor Sasa Misailovic](https://misailo.cs.illinois.edu/), and [Professor Gagandeep Singh](https://ggndpsngh.github.io/). We work on a variety of fun topics in programming languages and machine learning. We have more exciting projects to come!

### **C3SR-URAI Research Program** ###
(Spring 2022) Worked with researchers from IBM on a topic in federated learning as part of the C3SR-URAI research program.

### **Laboratory for Advanced Space Systems at Illinois** ###
(Fall 2019 - Spring 2020) Built an automated system to measure the moment of inertia of [LASSI](https://lassiaero.web.illinois.edu/)'s CubeSat and tested the satellite's attitude determination software. Also worked on a browser-based graphical interface for the lab's mission operations center.

### **Teaching (Course Assistant)** ###
(Fall 2020 & Spring 2021) [CS 225 Data Structures](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs225/sp2021/).
Helped students with machine problems and labs in weekly lab sections and office hours.  

(Spring 2020) [CS 126 Software Design Studio](https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/cs126/sp2020/staff/).
Facilitated weekly 2-hour code reviews with 5 students, which consisted of project presentations and discussions of program design, style, and testing. Also graded students' projects.


## Projects ##
<hr style="margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: 1em; height: 2px; background-color:black; border:none" />

### **Illinois Computer Science Sail Website** ###
[Source Code](https://github.com/SAIL-UIUC/sail-website). _Created with Django and hosted on an Apache server with a MySQL database._  
I wrote a brand-new website over the 2020 summer for UIUC's Sail event, [linked here](https://sail.cs.illinois.edu/), which is currently maintained by the wonderful 2022 Sail Staff. The website allows teachers and students to easily sign-up for accounts and create/register for courses; it also has an interface for administrative tasks like sending massmails to participants.

### **Tranzlate: The Zoom Translator** ###
[Source Code w/ Demo](https://github.com/remyang55/tranzlate). _Created with React.js._  
I made this for HackIllinois' [HackThis](https://hackthis.hackillinois.org/) virtual hackathon. The web app provides a convenient interface to translate Zoom meetings on-the-fly: on the top is a zoom meeting window, while on the bottom is a scrolling text box that transcribes and translates the meeting audio.

### **Finger Ninja** ###
[Source Code](https://github.com/remyang55/finger-ninja). _Created with C++ openFrameworks._  
I created this as a final project for UIUC's CS 126 Software Design Studio class. The game uses openFrameworks' openCV library so that you can play the classic Fruit Ninja game by swiping your finger in front of your laptop's webcam.

### **High School Stuff** ###
There are also some small applets I wrote in high school, which are not on GitHub as I didn't use source control back then (good thing I learned it now!). But here are some fun games that I cowrote (with original music and artwork!) for a video game programming class: [Time Will Tell](https://gamejolt.com/games/TimeWillTell/357199) and [December 8th](https://gamejolt.com/games/December8/350027) (alluding to the assignment's due date).


## Fun Stuff ##  
<hr style="margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: 1em; height: 2px; background-color:black; border:none" />

I also love playing chess, trivia, and other strategy games. If you'd like to play, let me know!

**Chess:** I love playing chess! [Here](https://www.chess.com/member/pajamafairy) is my profile on chess.com and [here](https://lichess.org/@/pajamafairy) is my profile on lichess; I'm rated around 1900 on both of these sites.

**Sporcle:** I enjoy a nice trivia match from time to time (especially in the Geography section). [Here](https://www.sporcle.com/user/remythecooldude/) is my Sporcle account (the username is a little embarrassing, as I made the account back in sixth grade).
