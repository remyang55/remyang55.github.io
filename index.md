Hope you're having a great day, thanks for stopping by! I am a sophomore majoring in [Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/) who is interested in research and writing impactful software, originally from [Taipei](https://goo.gl/maps/fLFFyzRABR2QwTAE7). Please send me an email if you'd like to talk about anything at all!

**[Research + Teaching Experience:](research/)** Currently, I am working on probabilistic programming in the context of low-precision computations with [Jacob Laurel](https://jsl1994.github.io/) and [Professor Sasa Misailovic](http://misailo.cs.illinois.edu/). I am also a course assistant for [CS 225 Data Structures](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs225/sp2021/).

**[Projects:](projects/)** I've coded a few fun projects like a Zoom Translator, Fruit Ninja game, and the website for Illinois Computer Science's Sail event.

**[Fun Stuff:](fun-stuff/)** I also love playing chess, trivia, and other strategy games. If you'd like to play, let me know! You can find my accounts by clicking the subtitle's hyperlink.
