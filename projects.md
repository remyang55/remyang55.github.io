Here are a few fun projects that I worked on!

#### Illinois Computer Science Sail Website ####
[Source Code](https://github.com/SAIL-UIUC/sail-website). _Created with Django and hosted on an Apache server with a MySQL database._  
I wrote a brand-new website over the 2020 summer for UIUC's Sail event, [linked here](https://sail.cs.illinois.edu/), which is currently maintained by the wonderful 2021 Sail Staff. The website allows teachers and students to easily sign-up for accounts and create/register for courses; it also has an interface for administrative tasks like sending massmails to participants.

#### Tranzlate: The Zoom Translator ####
[Source Code w/ Demo](https://github.com/remyang55/tranzlate). _Created with React.js._  
I made this for HackIllinois' [HackThis](https://hackthis.hackillinois.org/) virtual hackathon. The web app provides a convenient interface to translate Zoom meetings on-the-fly: on the top is a zoom meeting window, while on the bottom is a scrolling text box that transcribes and translates the meeting audio.

#### Finger Ninja ####
[Source Code](https://github.com/remyang55/finger-ninja). _Created with C++ openFrameworks._  
I created this as a final project for UIUC's CS 126 Software Design Studio class. The game uses openFrameworks' openCV library so that you can play the classic Fruit Ninja game by swiping your finger in front of your laptop's webcam.

#### High School Stuff ####
There are also some small applets I wrote in high school, which are not on Github as I didn't use source control back then (good thing I learned it now!). But here are some fun games that I cowrote (with original music and artwork!) for a video game programming class: [Time Will Tell](https://gamejolt.com/games/TimeWillTell/357199) and [December 8th](https://gamejolt.com/games/December8/350027) (alluding to the assignment's due date).
