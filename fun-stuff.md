Please let me know if you'd like to play a game or two!

**Chess:** I love playing chess! [Here](https://www.chess.com/member/pajamafairy) is my profile on chess.com and [here](https://lichess.org/@/pajamafairy) is my profile on lichess; I'm rated around 1900 on both of these sites.

**Sporcle:** I enjoy a nice trivia match from time to time (especially in the Geography section). [Here](https://www.sporcle.com/user/remythecooldude/) is my Sporcle account (the username is a little embarrassing, as I made the account back in sixth grade).
